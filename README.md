# Witcher Web

## Project Overview
This is my first website built using React. It is a three-page web application with the following pages:

- **Home Page**: Displays character information.
- **Bestiary Page**: Showcases various monsters.
- **Skill Tree Page**: Displays available skills.

The information showcased is from **_The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_**.

## Current Progress
- Implemented a **fully responsive navbar** that works on all devices (mobile, laptops, etc.).
- Added **light and dark mode** support.
- No pages have been completed yet.

## Future Plans
- Expand the project into a full-stack application.
- Fetch and display monster info, character info, and skill data dynamically.
- Learn and integrate backend technologies as I progress.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Download the project**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```sh
   cd project-folder-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

## Running the Project
